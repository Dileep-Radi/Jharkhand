        <h3>HUNDRU FALLS</h3>
        <img src="../../../media/images/hundru_falls/1.jpg" alt="Hundru falls">
        <p>Hundru Falls is a waterfall located in Ranchi District in the Indian state of Jharkhand. 
            It is the 34th highest waterfall in India, and one of the most famous tourist places in the region.
            Hundru Falls are located on the course of the Subarnarekha River where it falls from a height of 98 metres (322 ft), 
            creating one of the highest waterfalls in the state. The spectacular scene of the waterfalls has been described as 
            "a sight to behold". The different formations of rock due to the erosion by the constantly falling of water have 
            added to the beauty of the place. Hundru Falls is an example of a knickpoint, caused by rejuvenation. A knickpoint, also 
            called a nick point or simply nick, represents a break in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river. The break in channel
            gradient allows water to fall vertically, giving rise to a waterfall
